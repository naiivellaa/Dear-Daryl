    My dearest Daryl,
    <br>My love whose smile brighter than Sudirman's lights, there's a law somewhere that says that when one person is thoroughly smitten with the other,
    <br>the other must unavoidably be smitten as well. "Amor ch'a null'amato amar perdona." Love, which exempts no one who's loved from loving, Francesca words in the Inferno
    <br>but I thought that law was a scam because I have love you for 2 summer but at that time you haven't love me back up until you confessed your love to me on 29th October and I started believing it again.
  </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="wisdom">
        <ul>
            My dearest Daryl,
        <br>Falling for you was like witnessing fireworks for the first time. I find myself in constant awe when I'm with you. Thinking of you makes my heart burst like fireworks every time. I had never encountered a soul as pure as yours.
        <br>Every moment with you felt like a beautiful melody playing in my heart. EVerything about you is truly a work of art. You made me fall for you so naturally.
        <br>I long to shower you with the love you deserve. A pure soul like yours deserves the purest form of love. You are so far engraved into my soul and existence that no one could ever truly understand me without, at the very least, hearing your name. 
        <br>You know people say that you can't love someone unless you love yourself first and I think that's a lie because I have never loved myself but I loved you so much that I forgot what hating myself felt like.
        <br>If you were to be the sun, I would be icarus, a fool fated to fall and burn before I reach you. Even on wings of wax, I would still fly towards you.
        <br>Words are beautiful. To produce them, I allow my fingers to move about in a rhythmic and rather therapeutic manner. These movements then deliver my thoughts and emotions into the minds of human beings that cannot be reached by the sound of my voice.
        <br>I think it's time for me to start understanding that you are now one of those people that is out of my reach. I want you to know that I love you. I love you through every emotional part of roller coaster we have been throughout our relationship. I love you on the days that you were sweet and kind to me but 
        <br>I too love you during the days that you weren't in the mood and unrecognizable to me. For all the days that you made me feel loved and appreciated I am out of words to tell you how grateful I am with you. When my arms can't hug you, I hope my prayers do.
        <br>Sometimes, words seem so small compared to what I feel for you, but I’ll try my best to capture the love that fills my heart whenever I think of you. You’re not only my boyfriend but also my partner, my inspiration, and my constant. Every day, I find more reasons to appreciate you, admire you, and, most importantly, love you even more.
        <br>When I say “I love you,” I mean that I see everything beautiful in you—your kindness, your dreams, and even your unique quirks. I love how thoughtful you are, how you push yourself despite your struggles, and how you constantly strive to be your best. You remind me of the strength and resilience it takes to face challenges head-on, and I’m so proud of you for everything you accomplish, even if you can’t always see it yourself.
        <br>Your presence in my life has been a gift beyond words. You’ve taught me so much about love, trust, and vulnerability. With you, I’m learning what it means to truly give myself to someone, not out of need, but out of a genuine desire to make you feel valued, loved, and enough—because you are. I feel lucky to be the one who gets to remind you of that every day.
        <br>I understand that life can sometimes get overwhelming, and I know you may feel uncertain or doubt yourself. But through it all, I’m here, wholeheartedly, to stand by you. I want to be someone you can lean on, someone who loves you exactly as you are, even when things feel difficult. I want to be a safe place where you never have to question if you’re enough, because, to me, you always are.
        <br>I promise to keep doing my best to make you feel special, appreciated, and loved, as you deserve. You mean the world to me, and there’s no way I could ever put into words just how deeply I care for you. I hope that in every smile, every laugh, and every quiet moment together, you feel my love and know just how much you mean to me.
        <br>Thank you for being my everything. I love you, sayang.

    Teruntuk yang tersayang Daryl,
    <br>Dalam hidup kita enggak mungkin bisa bahagia selalu kan? Bahkan akan ada waktu yang bikin kita enggak mau lanjutin semuanya. Dalam hidup juga, kita selalu punya alasan untuk segala hal yang kita lakukan.
    <br>Kebetulan dari seluruh manusia yang ada di dunia ini,seorang lelaki dengan presensi secerah dan sehangat mentari hadir di bulan Agustus. Rasanya, saat enggak ada alasan lagi untuk bahagia kamu seakan berkata "Aku di sini"
    <br>Kamu hadir layaknya cahaya di tengah pekatnya malam. Kamu hadir menenangkan riuhnya kepala ini. Awalnya, enggak pernah terpikirkan bahwa senyuman tenang itu  yang selalu aku cari tiap masa dimana mana.
    <br>Enggak pernah terpikirkan bahwa hati ini bisa membawa rasa sayang yang amat besar untuk seseorang. Enggak pernah terpikirkan bahwa mendengar suara alunanmu adalah sesuatu yang menenangkan. Enggak pernah terpikirkan merayakan ulang tahunnya menjadi suatu momen yang selalu ditunggu setiap tahun.
    <br>Serta mulia, sang pemilik bulan Agustus dan selamat ulang tahun cinta hatiku
